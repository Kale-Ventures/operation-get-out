            h2.text-tertiary.mb-3 Our Team
            p We have spent a lifetime devoted to taking individuals and groups into nature and on the water. When we lost two of our own within six months of each other, both Travis County female first responders, StarFlight nurse Kristin McLain, to a flight rescue incident, and Senior Deputy, Jessica Hollis, to a flood incident, we were suddenly surrounded by first responders and others dealing with loss, anxiety, depression and trauma, asking us to take them to the water, just as Kristin and Jessica used the water for their own respite and release.
            p A collaborative relationship with Wallace J. Nichols and the science and understanding of Blue Mind resulted, and since then we have shared the science and unlocking power of being in, near or on the water with first responders, veterans, women, foster children, struggling youth, and individuals battling illness or grief.

            h2.mb-3.text-tertiary Our Philosophy
            p Blue Mind is at the heart of our organization. Marine biologist Dr. Wallace J. Nichols wrote a best seller about the remarkable effects of water in all of its shapes and forms on our health and well-being. Combining cutting-edge neuroscience with compelling personal stories from top athletes, leading scientists, military veterans, and gifted artists, he shows how proximity to water can improve performance, increase calm, diminish anxiety, and increase professional success. Look for our Blue Mind events coming soon.
