In the 2023 10th Annual Get Out Girl Surf and Paddle Jam, 115 women and girls of all ages took part in Surf Jam and over 220 in Paddle Jam. $75k was raised to help provide resources for military and first responders to Get Out for positive mental wellness impact. A huge shout out for the support of all the volunteers, donors and sponsors to get all of these women on the water for such an amazing cause!
