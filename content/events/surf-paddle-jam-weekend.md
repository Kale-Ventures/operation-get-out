***Our 10th Annual Event that any girl who loves the water does not want to miss!***

Saturday, Surf Jam & Sunday Paddle Jam  and weekend after party with food, DJ Coy, silent and live auctions with family and friends!

Camaraderie, inspiration, and empowerment with amazing like-minded women paddling in memory and honor of Travis County first responders Kristin McLain and Jessica Hollis. All proceeds provide nature and water events, experiences and equipment for front-line workers, military, nurses, surviving family and agencies through Operation Get Out, a 501c3 nonprofit.
