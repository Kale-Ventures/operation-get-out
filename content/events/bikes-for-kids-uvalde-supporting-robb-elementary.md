Operation Get Out, WEDU, Ski Dock, Mellow Johnny's, SRAM, Giant Bicycles, HEB, San Antonio Sports Foundation, Winter Garden Produce, and hundreds of volunteers built, transported, staged and embraced the children returning to school from the Robb Elementary community in August 2022 in Uvalde, Texas. Over 800 bicycles, helmets, locks, tubes, special needs trikes, art supplies, info kits, and stuffed animals were made available through endless volunteer support and donations.
