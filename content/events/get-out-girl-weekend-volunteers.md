When's the last time you considered the life of a female first responder, military or nurse? Taking care of and/or protecting our community during shift, managing life and death situations, serving others gracefully and graciously. This is a great opportunity to return the favor and serve them in return.

In our tenth year, Get Out Girl weekend has grown to over 300 participants in a two day period equating to almost 20 boats on Saturday and touching over 200 paddleboards more times than you want to count on Sunday. Not to mention, providing on the water support, food, drinks, clean up and set up. In Get Out Girl tradition, typically men serve and women participate - but all help is welcome! It takes a village to pull this one off - but it's an amazing way to honor and serve female first responders, military and nurses.

Please join us by signing up for one of several volunteer shifts.
