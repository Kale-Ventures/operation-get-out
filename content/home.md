ourStoryEyebrow: Our Story
ourStoryHeadline1: It started out of a love of the outdoors and a need to heal.
ourStoryCopy1: We have devoted our lives to bringing individuals and groups into
  nature and onto the water. But when we lost two of our own within six months
  of each other, StarFlight nurse Kristin McLain and Senior Deputy Jessica
  Hollis, both Travis County first responders, were suddenly surrounded by
  others dealing with loss, anxiety, depression and trauma. They turned to us
  for nature, water and healing —  asking us to help them heal through some of
  the same activities Kristin and Jessica used for their own respite.
ourStoryHeadline2: Then we looked to science to validate what we were seeing.
ourStoryCopy2: A pursuit of the science and validation behind nature and water
  as medicine began, including guidance and partnerships with Wallace J. Nichols
  and the science of Blue Mind; the Global Wellness Institute; International
  Surf Therapy Organization; peer support advisors; and mental wellness
  counselors. OpGetOut is committed to helping others be intentional in using
  nature and water as a powerful tool for positive mental and emotional wellness
  impact.

  - quote: Operation Get Out has opened my eyes and taught me how important it is to
      take care of myself. It has taught me how important it is to say I’m not
      ok and to find help and healing through therapy and most important, to me,
      my blue mind!
