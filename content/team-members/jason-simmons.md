name: Jason Simmons
bio: Jason has been a friend and volunteer with OGO since its inception and joined us in 2022 in a more formal sense to help accelerate and drive our mission to greater heights. He has a passion for water sports dating back to childhood experiences of water-skiing, surfing, and racing catamarans on the Chesapeake Bay, and military roots as his father served in the US Navy. In 2000, Jason settled his family on the banks of Lake Austin where water activities are not only a part of everyday life, but a very positive impact on mental wellness. Professionally he has a knack for operations and data and works as a data analyst for Dun & Bradstreet. In his spare time he also is an avid airplane pilot and flight instructor where many weekend days are spent either teaching/refining his student's flying capabilities or shuttling his clients to/from locations all around Texas and beyond.
