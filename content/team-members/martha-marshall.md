name: Martha B. Marshall, M.A., LPC
bio: 'Martha Marshall is a licensed counselor who utilizes nature and water as co-therapists. Her creative approach to change might include nature as a co-therapist: a walk outdoors under the oaks, a hike, or even counseling in a paddle boarding session on Austin lakes to help get in touch with the deeper, inner-knowing and strength we all forget sometimes. Her goal in work with clients is their return to balance, new perspectives, and a welcoming of their whole, wise soul. Martha presents workshops on the mind-body connection, mindful self-compassion, and family dynamics, and leads outdoor meditation experiences. She is a NADA Acudetox Specialist and NADA Registered Trainer licensed by the Texas Medical Board for acupuncture to treat addictions. Martha has NOLS Wilderness First Aid certification.'
