name: Kyle Hendirx
bio: With his positive spirt and love of the outdoors, Kyle began his journey
  with us as a volunteer and soon moved to an OGO Ambassador. After using
  water-based therapies to heal from a CNS injury, he is living proof of the
  healing power of water and physical movement. Before starting a career in the
  watersports industry, Kyle was a hike, paddleboard and kayak guide as well as
  a boat captain, fishing guide and fitness instructor. When he's not working
  with OGO as a boat captain and in event support, he can be found mountain
  biking, camping, paddleboarding and exploring nature's beauty.
